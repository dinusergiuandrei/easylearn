### Introduction
### Development notes
You can use the IDE of your choice. Whenever submitting changes to the repository make sure that you don't include files that are specific to your operating system or IDE (e.g., files generated by Eclipse, files generated by IntelliJ, etc).

### Project structure

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have the jdk installed on your system.
2. If you receive a "Gradle does not find tools.jar" or similar error, than make sure that the JAVA_HOME path variable is set to the location of your jdk installation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11345193/gradle-does-not-find-tools-jar (example for Windows); only follow the instructions from the first screen capture.

### Importing the project in IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open Intellij IDEA
2. File -> Open
3. Navigate to the base directory of the project/repository
4. Select the build.gradle file from this directory and then OK
5. Select Open as Project
6. Check the **Use auto-import** option
7. If you receive an error that specifies that the project is already created in the directory, delete the directory/repository and clone the repository again. **This will delete any changes that were made locally and were not pushed to GitHub, you will loose them.**

### Development workflow
0. The first time you should clone the project locally. This step should be skipped in future iterations.
1. Pull the latest version from github locally before adding any other code. This should be done each time.
2. Add the code to the project.
3. Build the project to make sure that your changes are successfully integrated (see the next section). If any errors are displayed you should resolve them.
4. If the build is successfull, then run the project (see the next section).
5. Test your changes manually (e.g., verify that the changes work as expected on the endpoint, UI, etc).
6. If your changes work as expected make a new commit that includes the files.
7. Pull locally any changes that might be submitted to the repository in the meantime and merge them manually if necessary (most of the times git will handle them automatically).
8. Push the changes to github.

### Building the project
In order to **build** the project, position yourself in the root directory of the project and use the following command depending on your operating system:
* Windows: **gradlew.bat build**
* Linux: **./gradlew build**

### Running the project
In order to **run** the project, position yourself in the root directory of the project and use the following command depending on your operating system:
* Windows: **gradlew.bat bootRun**
* Linux: **./gradlew bootRun**
* The application will start at the port specified in the **application.properties** file, which is located in the resources folder. The current application port is set to 8100. After starting the project access it: http://localhost:8100/
* The HTTP API exposed by the application can be accessed manually at the following endpoint: http://localhost:8100/swagger-ui.html
